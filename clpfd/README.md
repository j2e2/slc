# slc, clpfd support
This is a version of [**slc**](https://github.com/j2e2/slc) that runs on the library [**clpfd**](http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=clpb).

*clpfd* adds support for *constraints* over *finite domains*.

This supports all the operators and terms of the original, non constrained.

See, [slc/README.md](https://github.com/j2e2/slc/blob/master/README.md)
