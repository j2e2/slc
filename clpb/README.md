# slc, clpb support
This is a version of [**slc**](https://github.com/j2e2/slc) that runs on the library [**clpb**](http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=clpb).

*clpb* adds support for *constraints* over *booleans*.

This supports all the operators and terms of the original, non constrained.

See, [slc/README.md](https://github.com/j2e2/slc/blob/master/README.md)

Notes:
   
   *Debian 8* ships with an outdated version of this library, so I'm using a local copy instead of the one shipped with the package *SWI-Prolog*.
